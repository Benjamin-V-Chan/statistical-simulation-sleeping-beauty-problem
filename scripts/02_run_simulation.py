# Import required libraries
import csv

# Load trials from the generated CSV file

# Initialize counters for different scenarios:
#   - Total awakenings
#   - Awakening when coin is Heads
#   - Awakening when coin is Tails

# Loop through trials:
#   - Count how often Sleeping Beauty wakes up
#   - Count how often each coin flip occurs

# Compute the empirical probability that the coin landed on Heads when she is asked

# Save results to a new CSV file
