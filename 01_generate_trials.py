# 01_generate_trials.py

# Import necessary libraries
import json
import csv
import random

# Load configuration settings from config.json
# Read the number of trials

# Create a list to store trial outcomes
# For each trial:
#   - Flip a fair coin (Heads or Tails)
#   - Determine wake-up schedule based on coin flip:
#     - Heads: Wake on Monday only
#     - Tails: Wake on Monday and Tuesday
#   - Store the trial outcome (trial ID, coin flip result, wake-up days)

# Save trials to a CSV file for later use
